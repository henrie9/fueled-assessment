Frontend Exercise

Component Structure: I decided to break down the page into reusable components to improve maintainability and reusability. I created separate components for the navbar, question, and answer form.
State Management: I used React's state and redux to manage the dynamic nature of the questionnaire. Each question form and its corresponding answer form are managed as separate components with their own state. The parent component handles the overall state of the questionnaire.
Saving JSON Data: When the "SAVE & SHARE" button is clicked, I implemented JSON data structure in the browser console.
Add, Delete and Re-order questions: I implemented this functionality.

Conclusion
Overall, this project provided an opportunity to practice building a dynamic form using React. I encountered challenges in managing the state. By breaking down the components and carefully managing the state, I was able to create a functional questionnaire builder with the specified interactions.

I tried to meet all the requirements. (Attention to detail, Make sure it's responsive, Make your solution accessible, Build your components from scratch, Make the custom controls general purpose and reusable)

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further clarification on any aspect of the project.
